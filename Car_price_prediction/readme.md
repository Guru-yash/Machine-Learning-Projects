A car price prediction model aims to estimate the selling price of a car based on features such as year, mileage, fuel type, engine size, and transmission. To build this model using Linear Regression and Lasso Regression, we first require libraries like pandas and numpy for data handling, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, and scikit-learn modules (LinearRegression, Lasso, train_test_split, OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler, and evaluation metrics like mean_squared_error and r2_score) for modeling and assessment. The workflow begins with loading and exploring the dataset to check for missing values and understand feature distributions. Categorical features are encoded, and numerical features can be scaled, especially for Lasso, which is sensitive to feature magnitude. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets. Linear Regression is trained to provide a baseline, while Lasso Regression, which adds L1 regularization, helps reduce overfitting and can shrink less important feature coefficients to zero. After training, the models are evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error and RÂ² score, and performance is compared. Overall, Linear Regression offers a simple, interpretable approach, whereas Lasso improves generalization and feature selection in the presence of multiple features.
